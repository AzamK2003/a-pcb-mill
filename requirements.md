# Senior Project

Making PCBs for a hobbyist can be frustrating because of lead times. While it is incredible that we can get high quality PCBs from manufacturers within a week, there are still some significant gripes to contend with.

- **Shipping can be expensive** - Sometimes you just want a small, simple PCB which will cost 5 dollars, but then you get a shipping fee of 20 dollars which can make you think twice about whether you really need that PCB.

- **Rapid prototyping is not possible** - A one-week lead time is impressive, but can still be too slow. If you need the PCB to continue the project, you really can't do anything for that week until they arrive. If you made a mistake, you then have to repeat the process which can become incredibly time consuming and frustrating. And paying for faster shipping just makes the whole process more expensive.

Our solution to this would be to make a highly accessible and inexpensive PCB mill that almost any mid to high level electronics enthusiast could use. The purpose of this mill would not be to replace purchasing of PCBs from actual manufacturers. This mill would serve as a way to make "draft" PCBs that the user could test and verify before sending the design to a actual manufacturer. (If users are satisfied with the quality of the draft PCBs they could just use those in their projects too if the wish.) 

# Goals

- Rig a 3D printer gantry with an end mill. (What could possibly go wrong?)
  - Test its accuracy and determine feasibility.
  - If we can't make the 3D printer accurate enough, we'll have to find some other solution or a compromise.
- Single layer milling
  - Cut some copper-clad
- Through-hole drilling
- Solder mask scraping
  - Make a custom spring-bit to remove rolled on solder mask to expose pads.

## Stretch goals
- Two layer milling
  - Finding a reliable way to align the two sides well is super important.
- Via insertion?

## Super stretch goals

- Pick-and-Place (PnP) attachment
- Solder paste printer

## Specifications
(We'll figure these out later as we check the feasibility of rigging a 3D printer gantry)

- Minimum track width: ~0.5mm?
- Minimum via size: ???
